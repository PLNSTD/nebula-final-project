## Features

- **City Population Data:** Fetches and stores population data for cities across different countries. The API allows access to the top 10 most populous cities in each country, with the ability to scrape data and keep the database up to date.
- **Population projections:** Provides detailed population projections, including charts and data up until the year 2095. These projections are stored in the database and can be accessed via the API to visualize trends.
- **Web Scraping Compliance:** Fully adheres to the website's `robots.txt` rules, ensuring all scraping activities are compliant with the website's guidelines and restrictions.
